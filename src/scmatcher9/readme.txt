1.Running the program
  ./scmatcher9

2.Load Codebook
  Before pressing this, you shoudl check the Load/Use Image Patches checkbox, shuch that the patches will be visualzed at the bottom, and can be used elsewhere.  The Codebook is trained in the clusterer9 program.

3.Compute Occurrences
  Load the images with corresponding segmentation maps stored in the ./maps directory(as the readme.txt in the main dir has declared). This process is part of the training process, where the occurrences of the patches in the codebook in the sample images are stored and analyzed. Then you should save it.
