Installation Instructions
=========================

The provided archive contains all executables and libraries needed to
run the ISM detector code. However, when first installing 

1.) Create a symbolic link from "~/code" to the provided "code"
subdirectory. This is required, so that the detector can find the
feature extraction binaries.

ln -s $PWD/code ~/code


2.) Download and install the provided detector codebooks from our web
page (http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/bleibe/code/). It is recommended
that all detector codebooks are installed in the same directory
"~/codebooks" (or some other similarly accessible directory). Since
the detector files still contain some references to absolute paths, it
is necessary to run the provided script "prepare.sh" after installing
a new batch of codebooks. This automatically adapts the stored paths.

cd ~/codebooks
./prepare.sh


3.) Now, the detector binaries can be executed by running the script
"start.sh". 

PLEASE SEE THE FILE "README.TXT" FOR DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO USE
THE DETECTOR BINARIES!!!
